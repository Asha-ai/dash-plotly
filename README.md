# dash-plotly
Dash is an open-source Python framework used for building analytical web applications. It is a powerful library that simplifies the development of data-driven applications. It’s especially useful for Python data scientists who aren’t very familiar with web development. Users can create amazing dashboards in their browser using dash.

Built on top of Plotly.js, React, and Flask, Dash ties modern UI elements like dropdowns, sliders and graphs directly to your analytical python code.

Dash apps consist of a Flask server that communicates with front-end React components using JSON packets over HTTP requests.
